As I got older, I developed a fascination in vintage clothing, as well as high end clothing (I can not afford any of it, but its fun to know history behind it). As I got older, and had more freedom, I started buying more and more, to the point of having a massive collection of vintage clothing. This got me into selling some of my clothes, so that's what I do now! I work at a vintage clothing store here at school</p>

                <p>Cliche, I know
                    I love design. Basic, right? I couldn't not mention it, its one of my main hobbies. Sure, I get creative burn-out from time to time, but that has never stopped me. I know how to pace myself, and I know when to stop. Design is an important aspect of my life, and I don't think id be who I am today if I wasn't a designer; it feels almost hard-wired into my brain. Don't get me wrong, I love all types of design, from print to digital, but I started a new kind this year that I fell in love with; web design. The ability to build a website or app from the ground up with nothing but code is insane to me, I love it. The whole process behind it, from wireframes, to mocking up, to user testing, I love it all. Now im not saying I don't love other types of design; as long as I'm creative, my brain is happy. But UI/UX and web design is where I hope to end up. While I don't have a lot of work under my belt to show for it, I'm eager to learn more and more and ill take whatever steps necessary to do that.</p>
