                    I got to school at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. There, I am a Graphic
                    Design Major. I'm sure some people could have crazy stories on how they got into design, but mine is
                    a little lackluster; I bought Photoshop on my Moms laptop when I was about 15 years old (I got
                    grounded for that, it was expensive) and I loved just tinkering around with it. I ended up getting
                    into making sports edits (as most middle school boys do) and from then it was history!</p>

            <h3>I love fashion</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I always loved dressing up. Sure, my friends made fun of me, but who cares in the long run, right? As I got older, I developed a fascination in vintage clothing, as well as high end clothing (I can not afford any of it, but its fun to know history behind it). As I got older, and had more freedom, I started buying more and more, to the point of having a massive collection of vintage clothing. This got me into selling some of my clothes, so that's what I do now! I work at a vintage clothing store here at school</p>

            <h3>I love music</h3>
            <p>Hate to say it again, but ever since I was little I was fascinated with music. As with every other. Kid, I grew up listening to stuff my parents listened to in the car, which is why I am the way I am with music. My parents loved rock, so I grew up listening to bands like Pearl Jam, Guns n' Roses, Pink Floyd; you get the picture. Coming into college, I always wanted to learn how to play an instrument. Thanks to my roommate, Mike (a guitarist), he needed a bassist. So, I did what any good roommate would do, and I learned the bass. Thankfully, we already had a friend who had multiple basses, and could show me the ropes. I fell in love. It was so freeing to be able to hear a song, and think to yourself: “Hey, I can play that!” Or “Hey, I could learn to play that!”. I still have much more to learn, but im very happy with my progress so far. Some bands/musicians I enjoy are: Sonic Youth, The Smiths, Sweet Trip, Aphex Twin, Joy Division, Alex G, Elliot Smith; the list goes on and on. I love hearing new artists for the first time, so if anyone reading this has any suggestions, feel free to contact me!</p>

            <h3>I love cooking</h3>
            <p>I'll give credit where credits due, my love for cooking came from my mom. I always loved standing
                beside her, watching her make something delicious from bare ingredients. As a kid, I would
                experiment here and there in cooking, but ultimately I didn't start until I got to school and
                had my own kitchen. From there, it was history. I try my best to cook every night (even those
                late nights I'm up designing) and I try to expand my taste in food by trying different things;
                it keeps cooking exciting. While it may not always look the prettiest; it tastes good, and
                that's what matters.</p>

        <h3 class="col-4">Cliche, I know</h3>
        <p>I love design. Basic, right? I couldn't not mention it, its one of my main hobbies. Sure, I get creative burn-out from time to time, but that has never stopped me. I know how to pace myself, and I know when to stop. Design is an important aspect of my life, and I don't think id be who I am today if I wasn't a designer; it feels almost hard-wired into my brain. Don't get me wrong, I love all types of design, from print to digital, but I started a new kind this year that I fell in love with; web design. The ability to build a website or app from the ground up with nothing but code is insane to me, I love it. The whole process behind it, from wireframes, to mocking up, to user testing, I love it all. Now im not saying I don't love other types of design; as long as I'm creative, my brain is happy. But UI/UX and web design is where I hope to end up. While I don't have a lot of work under my belt to show for it, I'm eager to learn more and more and ill take whatever steps necessary to do that.</p>
